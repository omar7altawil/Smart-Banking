The smart banking system as mentioned before, is an IoT implemented system that is
used to help the visual impaired to access their banking services in an easier and faster
and more secure way, this is done by using the voice interface system (Alexa) by giving
it commands to control the banking system. The system can do anything from checking
the balance, to transferring money, to pay the bills to many more.
To do that first the user will have to login by using their voice, and then after that they
can access their banking services, now to make the system even more secure we added
a hardware button that is kept by the user to act as a two-factor authentication, this
button will be used when the user wants to do an action and this button can be modified
to be able to do a combination of presses that suits the user.
We also added a layer of security which is visual recognition using a camera, that is
designed to help the visually impaired to not get any sensitive information if there are
others in the room.
